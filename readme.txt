Easy, but complex widget website builder.

== Description ==

Easy is a multi-functional widget covering most of the native Wordpress functions commonly used in templates.
You can place almost any part of your content anywhere in your sidebars.

The widget is made out of drag&drop bits (bricks) and is totally up to you what you want to show on your website.

Showcase:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8KoQmQmXB0

Easy widget has variety of bricks representing the content and its logic. You can make simple or complex layout simply by dragging the bricks in to their slots and define on what cases it has to be shown or not.

Content bricks are:

 * title
 * content
 * featured image
 * categories
 * tags
 * taxonomies
 * custom meta
 * comments
 * author
 * date
 * shortcode
 * post gallery
 * sidebar
 * WPpagenavi (when installed)
 * ...
 * and even your own content bricks if you like
 
The resulting content is displayed based on the logic you build the same way as you did the content.
You just drag the logical bricks to their slot and the content will be shown based on that logic.
Logical bricks are:

 * Number of posts
 * post type chooser
 * offset
 * hierarchical logic (for pages and alike) 
 * category filter
 * custom meta filter
 * post status
 * edit link
 * permissions
 * meta filter
 * taxonomy filter
 * ...
 * and even your own logic bricks if you like
 
In adition to that the result can be designed to your needs. You can add your own classes to the whole widget (the HTML structure) and also to each content brick (a part of the content).
Then again it is totally up to you how you design your website.

Does it reminds you something?
Yes, it is exactly what you do when you design your template; you loop through the post or pages in your template, but this time without touching the code.
All the content and logical bricks are only graphical representation of the Wordpress functions.

The aim of this plugin is to speed up common programming work, so we do not have to repeat our selves.
Imagine a website made out of "sidebars" filled with widgets representing the list of last posts, menu, the image gallery, any content that is actually the website.
All built out of widgets that you can re-arrange anyway you or your client like right out of the admin area. That is the main purpose of the widgets anyway, Easy makes it real.

= Notice =
In order to have the website fast as light even with the Easy plugin heavily in charge use the W3TC caching plugin [[1](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/)]

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 

= Why I cannot use more then one instance of some control bricks? =

Yep, you cannot. You can do it only for some control bricks where it "makes sense".

= Why did you make such a thing for free? =

This is my reward to the WP community

It is possible and even more, it's easy. Check out the documentation <a href="http://2046.cz/easy/extend">Extend</a>.

== Upgrade Notice ==

* Please if you encounter any misbehavior, let my know on the forum. I'll be happy to fix it!
* If the widget behaves differently after the upgrade check out the particullar brick, if it hasn't have some new feature(s), which did not exist before. If so, correct values and re-save the widget.
* Always back up your widgets, do not let the sky fall. Use the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/widget-saver/">Widget saver</a> plugin.

 * The security time comes.
    All the input fields are now automatically escaped during the widget saving process. All the escapes techniques are defined for each field separately.
    If you define your own item (meaning, if you extend the Easy of by your own bricks), doesn't matter if View or Control you can choose from any Wordpress built in sanitize, escape function as well as native PHP functions and functions that comes with this plug-in (more in the Documentation).

 * FIX - VIEW - Taxonomies (Categories) - the class has not been considered when the number check box has not been checked
 * FIX - CONTROL - "For actual post/page" - the brick worked only for posts. From now on it guesses the actual post/page/... type and so you can make gallery for any post type automatically

 * NEW - CONTROL - "For actuallly viewed "post/page" - it will "guess" the actually visible post/page ID and shows the elements defined in the CONTENT slot. 
 This is usefull especially together with the  "Post gallery" VIEW brick. When you use them together it creates a gallery out of all images uploaded in that particular post/page automatically.

= 0.7 =

 * NEW - VIEW brick: internal type which is rendered after the view content.. (interesting only for developers)
 * NEW - VIEW brick: WP-Page navigation brick (Works when the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-pagenavi/">WP-Pagenavi</a> plugin is active

 * NEW - Controller restrictor - restrictor is a pseudo-controller.

= 0.4 =
 * NEW - all bricks can have multi input (select box, texarea, check box) -- hidden input, and radio in next release
